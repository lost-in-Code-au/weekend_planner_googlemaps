# weekend_router:

## MVP

Users should be able to:

1. Select start and finish locations for their route
2. Save routes to a wish-list
3. Mark completed routes as ‘done’

## Extras

Users should be able to:

4. See pubs along the route
5. Add notes to saved routes
6. Delete individual routes

## Setup

## Getting Started

First use the clone to download the repo, then unzip (if downloaded) in decided location.

Run NPM dependencies command in terminal
```sh
$ npm install
```
<br>
you will also need to require mongodb for the server database.

first of all you'll need to update your home brew with
```sh
brew update
```

once done, you can install mongodb with
```sh
brew install mongodb -g
```
which will install mongodb globally (-g)
<br>
now we get to the good part, start up your new mongodb with
```sh
mongod
```
then start your sever with
```sh
npm start
```
to start up sever, which should be on localhost:3000
<br>
remember if you want to edit the files you'll have to have webpack running (and our consent if you're doing anything but playing with the code).
to run webpack type
```sh
npm run bundle
```

#### As an option you can download and install the font for the page
It is called [KangarooSong]("http://www.1001freefonts.com/kangaroo_song.font")(click to download)

## Tips for debugging
```js
function = function(event) {
  console.log(event)
}
```
